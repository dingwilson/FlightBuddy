# PeerKit

## An open-source Swift framework for building event-driven, zero-config Multipeer Connectivity apps

## Usage

```swift
// Automatically detect and attach to other peers with this service type
PeerKit.transceive("com-jpsim-myApp")

enum Event: String {
    case StartGame, EndGame
}

// Send a StartGame event with attached data to all peers
PeerKit.sendEvent(Event.StartGame.rawValue, object: ["myInfo": "hello!"])
```

See the [CardsAgainst](https://github.com/jpsim/CardsAgainst) app for example usage. Specifically the [ConnectionManager](https://github.com/jpsim/CardsAgainst/blob/master/CardsAgainst/Controllers/ConnectionManager.swift) class.
